## Question 1.

a. $x<6$.

b. $$H_0: p\geq .5 \qquad H_1: p < .5$$

Suppose 3 successes out of 12 were observed.

```{r}
data <- c(rep(1, times = 3), rep(0, times = 9))
frequentist.test <- t.test(data, alternative = "less", mu = 0.5)

frequentist.test
frequentist.test$p.value
frequentist.test$p.value < 0.05
```
Results are significant under frequentist paradiagm, publish away.

c. Suppose now that
